Table:
| 50 photos | 100 photos
Horizontally | 3 | 4
Vertically | 5 | 4
Question: Beth just returned from a spring break volunteer trip. She is shopping for a photo album that will showcase her photos from the trip. The albums range in photo capacity and orientation. What is the probability that a randomly selected photo album is oriented vertically and holds exactly 50 photos? Simplify any fractions.
Answer: To find the probability that a randomly selected photo album is oriented vertically and holds exactly 50 photos, you can use the information from the table.
The total number of photo albums that can hold exactly 50 photos is the sum of the values in the "50 photos" row, which is 3 (Horizontally) + 5 (Vertically) = 8.
Out of these 8 albums that can hold 50 photos, the number of albums oriented vertically is 5.
So, the probability of selecting a photo album that is oriented vertically and holds exactly 50 photos is:
Probability = (Number of vertically oriented albums with 50 photos) / (Total number of albums with 50 photos)
Probability = 5 / 8
To simplify the fraction, you can divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1 in this case:
Probability = 5 / 8
So, the probability that a randomly selected photo album is oriented vertically and holds exactly 50 photos is 5/8.
The answer is 5/8.
Verdict:
Upon reviewing the provided answer for question:
The question asks for the probability that a randomly selected photo album is oriented vertically and holds exactly 50 photos.
The total number of albums mentioned in the table is the sum of all the albums that can hold either 50 or 100 photos. This is calculated as 3 (50 photos horizontally) + 5 (50 photos vertically) + 4 (100 photos horizontally) + 4 (100 photos vertically) = 16.
The number of albums oriented vertically and holding exactly 50 photos is 5.
Therefore, the probability should be calculated as follows:
Probability = (Number of vertically oriented albums with 50 photos) / (Total number of albums)
Probability = 5 / 16
The error in the original answer is in the denominator used for the calculation. The original answer incorrectly uses the total number of albums that can hold 50 photos (8) as the denominator, whereas the correct denominator should be the total number of albums mentioned in the table (16).
Therefore, the correct probability is 5/16.
So the verdict is: [[wrong]]
Improved Answer: The probability that a randomly selected photo album is oriented vertically and holds exactly 50 photos is [[5/16]].

Table:
[TITLE]: Students receiving scholarships
Year | Students
2008 | 33
2009 | 32
2010 | 31
2011 | 34
2012 | 29
Question: The financial aid office at Romero University produced an internal report on the number of students receiving scholarships. According to the table, what was the rate of change between 2011 and 2012?
Answer: To calculate the rate of change between 2011 and 2012, you can use the following formula:
Rate of Change = (Value at 2012 - Value at 2011) / (Year at 2012 - Year at 2011)
In this case, the values are:
Value at 2012 = 29 students
Value at 2011 = 34 students
Year at 2012 = 2012
Year at 2011 = 2011
Now, plug these values into the formula:
Rate of Change = (29 - 34) / (2012 - 2011)
Rate of Change = (-5) / (1)
Rate of Change = -5
So, the rate of change between 2011 and 2012 is -5 students per year.
The answer is -5.
Verdict:
Upon reviewing the provided answer:
The answer correctly identifies the values for the years 2011 and 2012 from the table: 34 students in 2011 and 29 students in 2012.
The rate of change formula used in the answer is appropriate for this context:
Rate of Change = (Value at 2012 - Value at 2011) / (Year at 2012 - Year at 2011)
The calculations are correctly applied: Rate of Change = (29 - 34) / (2012 - 2011) = -5 / 1 = -5
The conclusion that the rate of change between 2011 and 2012 is -5 students per year is accurate. This indicates a decrease of 5 students in the number of scholarship recipients from 2011 to 2012.
The answer correctly uses the given data and the appropriate mathematical formula to determine the rate of change. The mathematical process and the conclusion drawn are correct.
So the verdict is: [[correct]]
Improved Answer: The answer is [[-5]].

Table:
[TITLE]: Ferry fares
Ferry | Car | Bicycle
Seattle-Bremerton | $12 | $8
Mukilteu-Clinton | $7 | $5
Southport-Fort Fisher | $5 | $2
Fauntleroy-Vashon | $15 | $5
Ocracoke | $15 | $3
Question: For an economics project, Layla determined the cost of ferry rides for bicycles and cars. How much does it cost to take a bicycle on the Southport-Fort Fisher ferry?
Answer: To find the cost of taking a bicycle on the Southport-Fort Fisher ferry, you can refer to the table:
Southport-Fort Fisher | $5 | $2
The cost for a bicycle on the Southport-Fort Fisher ferry is $2.
So, it costs $2 to take a bicycle on this ferry.
The answer is 2.
Verdict:
Upon reviewing the provided answer:
The question asks for the cost of taking a bicycle on the Southport-Fort Fisher ferry.
The table provides the cost of ferry rides for both cars and bicycles.
The entry for the Southport-Fort Fisher ferry shows the cost for a bicycle as $2.
The answer correctly identifies this value from the table and states that it costs $2 to take a bicycle on the Southport-Fort Fisher ferry.
No calculations are needed as the information is directly available in the table.
The answer accurately extracts the relevant data from the table and correctly identifies the cost of taking a bicycle on the Southport-Fort Fisher ferry as $2.
So the verdict is: [[correct]]
Improved Answer: The answer is [[2]].

Table:
[TITLE]: Red buttons per bag
Stem | Leaf
1 | 0, 5, 6, 6, 6
2 | 3, 3, 5, 9, 9
3 | 0, 3
4 | 1, 4, 7
5 | 2, 4, 9
6 |
7 | 5
8 | 0, 2, 4, 6, 8
9 | 0
Question: An employee at the craft store counted the number of red buttons in each bag of mixed buttons. How many bags had at least 69 red buttons?
Answer: To find the number of bags that had at least 69 red buttons, you can follow these steps:
Find the row with stem 6. Count all the leaves greater than or equal to 9.
There are no leaves greater than or equal to 9 in the row with stem 6.
Find the row with stem 7. Count all the leaves in that row.
There is one leaf in the row with stem 7.
Find the row with stem 8. Count all the leaves greater than or equal to 9.
There are no leaves greater than or equal to 9 in the row with stem 8.
Find the row with stem 9. Count all the leaves in that row.
There is one leaf in the row with stem 9.
Now, add the leaves from steps 2 and 4:
1 (from stem 7) + 1 (from stem 9) = 2
So, there are 2 bags that had at least 69 red buttons.
Verdict:
Upon reviewing the provided answer:
The stem-and-leaf plot is designed where each stem represents the tens place, and each leaf represents the ones place in the number of buttons.
For the stems greater than 6 (i.e., 7, 8, and 9), every leaf corresponds to a bag with at least 69 red buttons, as the number of buttons in these bags will be in the range of 70-99.
Correct interpretation:
Stem 7 has one leaf (5), representing 75 buttons, accounting for 1 bag.
Stem 8 has five leaves (0, 2, 4, 6, 8), representing 80, 82, 84, 86, and 88 buttons, accounting for 5 bags.
Stem 9 has one leaf (0), representing 90 buttons, accounting for 1 bag.
Adding these: 1 (from stem 7) + 5 (from stem 8) + 1 (from stem 9) = 7
So, the corrected answer is that there are 7 bags that had at least 69 red buttons.
The initial answer was incorrect as it failed to count all bags represented by stems greater than 6.
So the verdict is: [[wrong]]
Improved Answer: There are 7 bags that had at least 69 red buttons. The answer is [[7]].
