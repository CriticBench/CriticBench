Question: Find the units digit of $13 \cdot 41$.
Answer: Let's think step by step
The units digit of $13$ is $3$, and the units digit of $41$ is $1$.
Multiplying these two numbers together, we get $3 \cdot 1 = \boxed{3}$.
The answer is 3
Verdict: The approach used in the given answer is a valid method for finding the units digit of a product of two numbers. To determine the units digit of the product of two numbers, you can indeed simply multiply the units digits of these numbers. The process outlined in the answer correctly identifies the units digit of 13 as 3 and the units digit of 41 as 1. Multiplying these, 3⋅1, indeed results in 3, which is the units digit of the product 13⋅41.
So the verdict is: [[correct]]

Question: A suitcase lock has 3 dials with the digits $0, 1, 2,..., 9$ on each. How many different settings are possible if all three digits have to be different?
Answer: Let's think step by step
For the first dial, there are 10 possible digits to choose from.
After choosing a digit for the first dial, there are 9 remaining digits to choose from for the second dial.
Similarly, after choosing digits for the first two dials, there are 8 remaining digits to choose from for the third dial.
Therefore, the total number of different settings is $10 \times 9 \times 8 = \boxed{720}$.
The answer is 720
Verdict: The approach used in the given answer is correct. This question is about permutations where you are choosing different digits for each of the three dials of a suitcase lock. The key point here is that the digits must be different for each dial.
For the first dial, indeed, you have 10 choices (0 through 9).
For the second dial, one digit has already been used, so there are 9 choices left.
For the third dial, two digits are already used, leaving 8 choices.
Thus, the total number of different settings is calculated by multiplying these choices together: 10×9×8, which equals 720. This is the correct calculation for the number of permutations where order matters and no repetition is allowed.
So the verdict is: [[correct]]

Question: Each of the symbols $\star$ and $*$ represents an operation in the set $\{+,-,\times,\div\}$, and $\frac{12\star 2}{9*3}=2$.  What is the value of $\frac{7\star 3}{12*6}$?  Express your answer as a common fraction.
Answer: Let's think step by step
We know that $\frac{12\star 2}{9*3}=2$.  Since $12\star 2$ and $9*3$ are both equal to 24, we must have $24/24=2$.  This means that $\star$ represents the operation of multiplication.  Therefore, $\frac{7\star 3}{12*6}=\frac{7\times 3}{12*6}=\frac{21}{72}=\boxed{\frac{7}{24}}$.
The answer is 7/24
Verdict: The equation $\frac{12\star 2}{9*3}=2$  is solved with the assumption that both $12\star 2$ and $9*3$ equal 24. This assumption is not correct.
The equation can be true if $\star$ is multiplication and $*$ is addition($\frac{(12\times2)}{(9+3)}=2$).
Therefore, the value of $\frac{7\star 3}{12*6}=\frac{7\times 3}{12+6}=\frac{21}{18}=\frac{7}{6}$
So the verdict is: [[wrong]]

Question: Keiko tosses one penny and Ephraim tosses two pennies. What is the probability that Ephraim gets the same number of heads that Keiko gets?  Express your answer as a common fraction.
Answer: Let's think step by step
There are $2^3=8$ possible outcomes for the three coin tosses.
The only outcomes in which Keiko and Ephraim get the same number of heads are HHT and TTH.
Therefore, the probability is $\boxed{\frac{2}{8}}=\boxed{\frac{1}{4}}$.
The answer is 1/4
Verdict: The approach used in the given answer for the probability question is incorrect. The error lies in the identification of the outcomes where Keiko and Ephraim get the same number of heads.
To solve this problem correctly, we should consider the separate probabilities for Keiko and Ephraim's coin tosses:
Keiko tosses one penny, so she can either get a Head (H) or a Tail (T). Each of these outcomes is equally likely, with a probability of 1/2.
Ephraim tosses two pennies. The possible outcomes are HH, HT, TH, TT. Each of these outcomes is equally likely, with a probability of 1/4.
Now, we need to consider the scenarios where Ephraim gets the same number of heads as Keiko. These scenarios are:
Keiko gets 1 head (H), and Ephraim gets 1 head (HT or TH).
Keiko gets 0 heads (T), and Ephraim gets 0 heads (TT).
The probability of each of these scenarios happening is:
For Keiko getting H (probability 1/2) and Ephraim getting exactly one head (probability 1/2, since out of HH, HT, TH, TT, only HT and TH match this condition), the combined probability is 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4.
For Keiko getting T (probability 1/2) and Ephraim getting no heads (probability 1/4, only TT matches), the combined probability is 1/2 * 1/4 = 1/8.
Therefore, the total probability is 1/4 + 1/8 = 3/8.
The original answer incorrectly assumes there are only two successful outcomes (HHT and TTH) out of 8 total outcomes, which is not the correct way to calculate this probability.
So the verdict is: [[wrong]]
