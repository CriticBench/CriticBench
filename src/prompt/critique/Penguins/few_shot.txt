Question: Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:  name, age, height (cm), weight (kg) Louis, 7, 50, 11 Bernard, 5, 80, 13 Vincent, 9, 60, 11 Gwen, 8, 70, 15  For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.  We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 5, 90, 12
How many penguins are less than 8 years old?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5
Answer: Let's think step by step.
This question focuses on age. We know the following: Louis is 7 years old, Bernard is 5 years old, Vincent is 9 years old, and Gwen is 8 years old.
The penguins that are less than 8 years old are Louis and Bernard.
There are 2 penguins less than 8 years old. So the answer is (B).
Verdict: The provided answer is incorrect. It correctly identifies Louis and Bernard as penguins less than 8 years old but fails to include James, who is also less than 8 years old. Therefore, the correct answer should be (C) 3, as there are three penguins less than 8 years old.
So the verdict is: [[wrong]]

We now add a penguin to the table:
Emily, 6, 65, 20
Which penguin is the heaviest?
Options:
(A) Louis
(B) Bernard
(C) Vincent
(D) Gwen
(E) Emily
Answer: Let's think step by step.
This question focuses on weight. We know the following:
The weight of Louis is 11 kg,
The weight of Bernard is 13 kg,
The weight of Vincent is 11 kg,
The weight of Gwen is 15 kg,
