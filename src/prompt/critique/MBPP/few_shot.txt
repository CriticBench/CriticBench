Review the provided answer and determine whether itâ€™s correct. If wrong, find the problems with it.
Finally, conclude with either '[[correct]]' if the provided answer is correct or '[[wrong]]' if it is incorrect.
Here are some examples:

Question:
You are an expert Python programmer, and here is your task: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists. Your code should pass these tests:
assert similar_elements((3, 4, 5, 6),(5, 7, 4, 10)) == (4, 5)
assert similar_elements((1, 2, 3, 4),(5, 4, 3, 7)) == (3, 4)
assert similar_elements((11, 12, 14, 13),(17, 15, 14, 13)) == (13, 14)
Answer:
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    res = tuple(test_tup1 & test_tup2)
    return (res)
Verdict: The provided function is incorrect. The '&' operator cannot be used directly with tuples to find common elements.
So the verdict is: [[wrong]]

Question:
You are an expert Python programmer, and here is your task: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers. Your code should pass these tests:
assert is_not_prime(2) == False
assert is_not_prime(10) == True
assert is_not_prime(35) == True
Answer:
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
Verdict: The provided function is correct and meets all the test cases. It checks whether a number is non-prime by iterating from 2 to the square root of the number and returning True if any of these numbers divide the given number.
So the verdict is: [[correct]]

Question:
You are an expert Python programmer, and here is your task: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm. Your code should pass these tests:
assert heap_queue_largest( [25, 35, 22, 85, 14, 65, 75, 22, 58],3)==[85, 75, 65]
assert heap_queue_largest( [25, 35, 22, 85, 14, 65, 75, 22, 58],2)==[85, 75]
assert heap_queue_largest( [25, 35, 22, 85, 14, 65, 75, 22, 58],5)==[85, 75, 65, 58, 35]
Answer:
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
    largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
    return largest_nums
Verdict: The provided function is correct and meets all the test cases. It uses the heapq.nlargest() function to find the n largest numbers from the given list.
So the verdict is: [[correct]]

Question:
You are an expert Python programmer, and here is your task: Write a Python function that checks if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization. Your function should return True if the input is a palindrome and False otherwise. Your code should pass these tests:
assert is_palindrome("racecar") == True
assert is_palindrome("hello") == False
Answer:
def is_palindrome(s):
    s = ''.join(e for e in s if e.isalnum()).lower()
    return s[::-1]
Verdict: The provided code is almost correct but has a small issue. It returns the reversed string but doesn't compare it to the original string to check if it's a palindrome.
So the verdict is: [[wrong]]
