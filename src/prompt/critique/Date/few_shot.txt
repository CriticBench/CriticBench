Question: Today is Christmas Eve of 1937. What is the date 10 days ago in MM/DD/YYYY?
Options:
(A) 12/14/2026
(B) 12/14/1950

(D) 12/14/1937
(E) 12/24/1937
(F) 12/14/1988
Answer: Let's think step by step.
If today is Christmas Eve of 1937, then today's date is December 24, 1937. So the answer is (E).
Verdict: The question asks for the date 10 days prior to December 24, 1937. To find this, we simply need to subtract 10 days from December 24, 1937. December 24, 1937 - 10 days = December 14, 1937. Therefore, the correct answer is December 14, 1937. The original answer provided was (E) 12/24/1937, which is actually the current date (Christmas Eve of 1937) and not the date 10 days prior.
So the verdict is: [[wrong]]

(F) 07/16/1988
Answer: Let's think step by step.
If City Z was founded on July 15, 1892, and it celebrated its 120th anniversary yesterday, then yesterday's date was July 15, 2012. Therefore, today's date is July 16, 2012, which is 07/16/2012. So the answer is (A).
Verdict: The question states that City Z celebrated its 120th anniversary on July 15, 1892. Adding 120 years, we get July 15, 2012, as the anniversary date. Since the anniversary was yesterday, today is July 16, 2012. The answer is (A), 07/16/2012. The original answer concludes that today's date is July 16, 2012, which is represented as 07/16/2012, and corresponds to option (A).
